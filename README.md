# Advanced Universal DB Tool

## Overview

The **Advanced Universal DB Tool** is a comprehensive solution designed to manage and interact with various types of databases, process structured and unstructured data, handle real-time data streams, manage caching systems, ensure data compliance with regulations 
like GDPR and HIPAA, and even support basic machine learning operations. This tool aims to simplify and unify the interaction with databases and data processing systems across different environments, making it a versatile utility for developers, data scientists, and 
system administrators.

## Features

### 1. Database Operations

- **Multi-Database Support**: Interact with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and Oracle databases.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations easily via CLI.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Ensures robust database connections with retry logic.
- **Secure Connections**: Integrates encryption for secure database communications.

### 2. Data Processing

- **Cleaning**: Remove unwanted characters, handle missing values, and standardize data.
- **Transformation**: Modify data format, aggregate data, and prepare it for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots and graphs to visualize data trends and patterns.

### 3. Cache Management

- **Redis Integration**: Utilize Redis to store and retrieve frequently accessed data.
- **Cache Operations**: Set, get, and delete cache entries efficiently.
- **TTL Management**: Option to manage Time-To-Live for cached entries.

### 4. Unstructured Data Processing

- **Text Processing**: Handle large text data for natural language processing tasks.
- **Image Processing**: Process and analyze images, with support for OCR via Tesseract.

### 5. Real-Time Data Streaming

- **Apache Spark Integration**: Stream data in real-time, process it on-the-fly, and apply SQL-like operations.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Checkpointing**: Ensures that stream processing can resume from a known state in case of failure.

### 6. Compliance Checks

- **GDPR**: Automatically check data against GDPR regulations.
- **HIPAA**: Ensure that data complies with HIPAA requirements.
- **Integration with Pipelines**: Seamlessly integrates into your data processing pipelines to enforce compliance at every stage.

### 7. Machine Learning

- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models with your data using simple CLI commands.
- **Prediction**: Use trained models to make predictions on new data.
- **Support for Multiple Algorithms**: Includes basic models like Linear Regression, with the possibility to extend to more complex ones.

### 8. Automation

- **Cron Job Management**: Set up and remove cron jobs for automated tasks.
- **Idempotency**: Ensure that automation scripts can be run multiple times without causing errors.
